## Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you, I'm Fabio Iotti 🙋‍♂️ I'm a professional C# .NET developer by day, at night I wear my React and TypeScript hobbyist costume. I'm a proud Linux user, and Godot enthusiast! You can find here on GitHub pretty much all of the code I have write non-professionally, usually released under a permissive license.

Why don't you take a look at my drafts and projects?

- [👨‍💻 C#](https://github.com/bruce965?tab=repositories&language=c%23&sort=stargazers)
- [🌐 TypeScript](https://github.com/bruce965?tab=repositories&language=typescript&sort=stargazers)
- [🎮 Godot](https://github.com/bruce965?tab=repositories&q=Godot&sort=stargazers)

For more serious stuff, take a look at my [professional repositories](https://github.com/fiotti?tab=repositories).

In preparation for GitHub's dark future, you can also find my projects on [my Forgejo forge](https://git.fabioiotti.com/bruce965), currently self-hosted on a tiny PC in my attic (very slow!).
